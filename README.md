# Overview

I'm a freelancer software architect for Azure, C#/.NEt. 
This is my contact site page for my company Thomas Schulze IT Solutions.

It fulfills two purposes. 
1. Provide a presentation for me and my company.
1. Be a playground for myself to try out a few things here and there.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure is written with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and deployed automatically with Terraform Cloud.

## Deployment

The application(s) itself are deployed with GitHub Actions.
